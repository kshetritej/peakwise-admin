- Analytics widgets for activity and approval status
- Server-side protected layout using cookies and session guard

## Technology Stack

- React Hook Form + Zod
- Zustand for state management
- Sonner for notifications

## Project Structure

- `app/` — Next.js app directory
  - `app/admin/` — login page and form
  - `app/(dash)/` — protected dashboard routes and admin UI pages
  - `app/layout.tsx` — root HTML layout
- `components/` — reusable UI components, atoms, molecules, organisms, and page components
- `lib/` — helper utilities, fonts, validation, and config
- `store/` — client-state management hooks

## Key Pages

- `/admin` — admin login page
- `/dashboard` — main dashboard analytics view
- `/featured-trips` — manage featured trip listings
- `/trips` — manage full trip catalog and trip approval status
- `/posts` — manage blog posts
- `/authors` — manage author profiles
- `/testimonials` — manage testimonials
- `/navbar` and `/footer` — manage navigation
- `/redirects` — manage redirect rules
- `/regions`, `/destinations`, `/activity-types`, `/trip-categories`, etc. — manage supporting taxonomy data

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The app runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Environment Variables

The app expects the following environment variables to connect to the API and configure the admin experience:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` — backend API base URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` — site name / domain used in UI branding
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL` — admin email displayed in the sidebar
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_BASE_URL` — site frontend URL used for preview links
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSITE_URL` — fallback website URL used in some redirect logic

## Scripts

- `pnpm dev` — start development server
- `pnpm build` — build production app
- `pnpm start` — run production server
- `pnpm lint` — run ESLint

## Notes

- The admin layout uses server-side cookie checking and redirects unauthorized users to `/admin`.
- API requests are made from client components using `fetch` with `credentials: "include"`.
- The project is structured as an admin-first dashboard rather than a public-facing site.
